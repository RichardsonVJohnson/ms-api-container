Here’s how to design the ScyllaDB model and NestJS REST API endpoints to support the YouTube-style comment UI:

1. Use Cases

The key functionalities required for the UI snippet are:
	1.	Add Comments: Users can post comments on a video.
	2.	Reply to Comments: Comments can have threaded replies.
	3.	Like/Dislike Comments: Users can like or dislike a comment.
	4.	Sort Comments: Comments can be sorted by “Top Comments” or “Newest First.”
	5.	Retrieve Comments: Fetch paginated comments for a video.
	6.	Rank Top Comments: Efficiently calculate the “Top Comments” based on likes, dislikes, and replies.

2. Data Model

The ScyllaDB schema should support the hierarchical structure of comments and allow for efficient querying. Below is the proposed schema:

Keyspaces and Tables

-- Keyspace
CREATE KEYSPACE youtube_comments
WITH replication = { 'class': 'SimpleStrategy', 'replication_factor': 3 };

-- Comments Table
CREATE TABLE youtube_comments.comments (
    video_id UUID,
    comment_id UUID,
    parent_comment_id UUID, -- NULL for top-level comments, non-NULL for replies
    user_id UUID,
    content TEXT,
    likes COUNTER,
    dislikes COUNTER,
    created_at TIMESTAMP,
    PRIMARY KEY ((video_id), created_at, comment_id)
) WITH CLUSTERING ORDER BY (created_at DESC);

-- Top Comments Ranking Table
CREATE TABLE youtube_comments.top_comments (
    video_id UUID,
    rank_score DOUBLE, -- Calculated score for ranking
    comment_id UUID,
    PRIMARY KEY ((video_id), rank_score, comment_id)
) WITH CLUSTERING ORDER BY (rank_score DESC);

Explanation
	1.	comments Table:
	•	Stores all comments and replies.
	•	Partitioned by video_id for fast retrieval of comments for a video.
	•	Supports hierarchical replies using parent_comment_id.
	2.	top_comments Table:
	•	Stores ranked comments for each video based on a calculated ranking score.
	•	rank_score allows efficient querying of top comments.

3. Algorithm for Ranking “Top Comments”

Ranking Formula

Rank comments using a weighted scoring formula based on:
	•	Number of likes.
	•	Number of dislikes.
	•	Number of replies.

Formula:

rank_score = (likes * 2) - (dislikes) + (reply_count * 1.5)

Implementation
	1.	Update the rank_score whenever a like, dislike, or reply is added.
	2.	Periodically recalculate scores using a background job for scalability.

4. REST API Endpoints

Endpoint Definitions

1. Add a Comment
	•	URL: POST /videos/:videoId/comments
	•	Payload:

{
  "userId": "UUID",
  "content": "string",
  "parentCommentId": "UUID (optional)"
}


	•	Description: Add a new comment or reply to an existing comment.

2. Like/Dislike a Comment
	•	URL: POST /videos/:videoId/comments/:commentId/reactions
	•	Payload:

{
  "type": "like | dislike"
}


	•	Description: Increment the like/dislike counter for a comment.

3. Get Comments
	•	URL: GET /videos/:videoId/comments
	•	Query Params:
	•	sort=top|newest
	•	pageToken=string
	•	pageSize=int
	•	Description: Retrieve paginated comments, sorted by “Top Comments” or “Newest First.”

4. Fetch Top Comments
	•	URL: GET /videos/:videoId/comments/top
	•	Query Params:
	•	limit=int (default: 10)
	•	Description: Retrieve the top-ranked comments for a video.

5. Testing

Use Postman or similar tools to test the endpoints. Create test data using the comments and top_comments tables to validate the ranking and retrieval mechanisms.

Conclusion

This implementation ensures:
	1.	Scalability: The ScyllaDB schema supports high write throughput and efficient querying.
	2.	Simplicity: Minimal boilerplate and intuitive APIs for the use cases.
	3.	Extensibility: Additional features like user notifications or analytics can be added easily.

	///////////CHANGE REQUEST////////////
	To retrieve replies to comments, the system must support hierarchical or nested data structures. Each reply needs to be associated with a parent comment. Here’s a detailed plan to support replies and retrieve them effectively:

Requirements
	1.	Database Schema Changes:
	•	Add a parent_id column to the comments table.
	•	If parent_id is NULL, it indicates a top-level comment.
	•	If parent_id contains a value, it represents a reply to the comment identified by that parent_id.
	2.	API Changes:
	•	Add an endpoint or extend the getComments function to retrieve replies for a specific comment.
	•	Include replies in the response for top-level comments if requested.
	3.	Frontend Considerations:
	•	Ensure the UI supports displaying nested replies.
	•	Implement lazy loading for replies to avoid loading large nested structures unnecessarily.

Database Schema Example

CREATE TABLE comments (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  video_id UUID NOT NULL,
  parent_id UUID NULL, -- Null for top-level comments
  text TEXT NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL
);

Retrieving Replies

Here’s how you can retrieve replies for a specific comment.

Changes for Supporting Replies
	1.	Schema Addition:
	•	Add parent_id to the comments table.
	2.	Frontend Changes:
	•	Allow users to view and post replies to a specific comment.
	•	Display nested replies as a tree structure or indented list.
	•	Implement lazy loading for large comment threads.
	3.	API Enhancements:
	•	Include a separate getReplies function for on-demand fetching.
	•	Optionally include replies within getComments.
	4.	Performance Considerations:
	•	Implement caching for frequently accessed comments and replies.
	•	Limit reply depth (e.g., maximum nesting level) to avoid excessive data fetching.
	5.	Testing:
	•	Unit and integration tests for retrieving replies and nested comments.
	•	Test edge cases like:
	•	Comments with no replies.
	•	Deeply nested replies exceeding limits.
	•	Invalid parent IDs.

Example Usage

Fetching Top-Level Comments

const comments = await getComments("video123", "newest", 10, undefined, true);
console.log(comments);

Fetching Replies for a Specific Comment

const replies = await getReplies("comment456", 5);
console.log(replies);

Frontend Display Example
	1.	Top-Level Comments:
	•	Display in a list.
	•	Include a “View Replies” button.
	2.	Replies:
	•	Lazy-load replies when “View Replies” is clicked.
	•	Nest replies beneath their parent comments.

By implementing this approach, you can effectively support and retrieve replies while maintaining scalability and performance.
